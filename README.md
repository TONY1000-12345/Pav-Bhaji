
Step 1: Saute Veggies

Select the high Sauté setting on the Instant Pot and heat 2 tablespoons of the
butter. Add the yellow onion, ginger, garlic, bell peppers and sauté until the onion
turns translucent about 5 minutes.

Add the cauliflower, potatoes, tomatoes, peas, and 2 teaspoons salt; pour in the 
water; and stir well with a wooden spoon, nudging loose any browned bits from the
pot bottom.


Step 2: Pressure Cook and mash with Spices

Secure the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Press 
the Cancel button, then select the Pressure Cook or Manual setting and set 
the cooking time for 6 minutes at high pressure.

Perform a quick release by moving the Pressure Release to Venting. Open the 
pot. Select the normal Sauté setting and mash all the veggies with a potato masher.

Stir in the tomato paste, pav bhaji masala, red chili powder, and turmeric,
followed by 2 tablespoons butter (optional but highly recommended). Cover the 
pot with a glass lid (or another non-locking lid that fits), as the bhaji may start 
to splatter, and cook until heated through about 5 minutes.

Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, paav bhaji masala, and chile powder if 
needed. Press the Cancel button to turn off the Instant Pot. Sprinkle with the cilantro.


Step 3: Cook the rolls or buns

Next, lightly butter the potato buns and toast each side on a heated griddle or a pan.

Spoon the bhaji onto plates, sprinkle with red onion, and serve with the toasted buns
and lime wedges on the side.
